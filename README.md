# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this new analysis is to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type. The visualizations created will help improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability to underserved neighborhoods. To complete this analysis, I used Python in Jupyter Notebooks. Some of the libraries I have used include: Pandas, Matplotlib, Statistics and Numpy.

## Results
Rural cities have the fewest number of total rides and drivers. On the other hand, rural cities have the highest average fare per ride. Rural drivers made the most money followed by suburban drivers. Urban cities bring in the most total fares followed by suburban and rural cities. Furthermore, the line graph below emphasizes urban cities bringing in the most total fares and rural cities bringing in the least total fares.

## Summary
Based on the results. I have 3 business recommendations to address possible disparities among city types.

- First - Rural cities price per fare should decrease slightly, giving more opportunities to the rural communities to use PyBer ride-sharing.
- Second - Urban cities fare per ride should increase slightly to bring in more revenue and in turn, create a higher average fare per driver. 
- Third - Suburban cities should remain unchanged, as it appears to be a good median between the urban and rural areas in terms of fares per ride, as well as fares per driver.
