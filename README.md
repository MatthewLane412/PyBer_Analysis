# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this new analysis is to create summary of the ride-sharing data by city type. The visualizations created will help improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability to underseved neighborhoods. To complete this analysis I used Python in Jupyter Notebooks. Some of the libraries i have used include: Pandas, Matplotlib, Statistics and Numpy.
